Hey Wardens, just want to mention that we'll have a detailed design doc for our contracts prepared over the next few hours to make it easier to understand.

Example flows mentioned here should be useful to get an overview of the how the interoperability mechanism works: https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-axelar#example-flows

Hi is it ready? And if so , where can I find it?


[04/10/2022 6:43 PM] abhinavmir#1898
Hi Axelar team. I'm wondering if you have test coverage and gas reporter enabled, but just not in this gH repo? Or is it something you're still considering?

@Milap | Axelar


[04/10/2022 9:00 PM] entangled_qubit
Hey, I added a bunch of info to the repo itself, I particularly recommend looking at the example flows: https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-axelar
The network design on the Cosmos side is not well documented yet, but for the purposes of the gateway contracts it shouldn't be too relevant if you understand the flow above. Our main Cosmos module that's responsible for preparing the signed commands to the gateway is located here:  https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-core/blob/main/x/evm/keeper/msg_server.go

Let me know if you have any questions!

You're welcome to report similar optimizations/issues if they occur in different places. We just prefer to not get the exact same report (same issue in the same function/logic) from the last contest (since we might not have fixed a report we considered not applicable or a lower priority issue).


[08/01/2022 4:18 PM] entangled_qubit

Nomad bridge getting actively hacked. WETH and WBTC being taken out in million-dollar increments. Withdraw all funds if you can, still $126m remaining in the contract that's likely at risk

@Milap | Axelar  would contract deployer be an EOA? Trying to figure out who deploys the gas service contract


[08/02/2022 11:53 PM] entangled_qubit
Contract deployer can also be a multisig wallet. Gas service will be deployed by the relayer+executor service that's executing the remote contract call. Axelar provides this service, but there can be other providers.


[08/03/2022 12:54 AM] 100proof
@Milap | Axelar In the docs it says `AxelarGateway` is partly in scope. What does this mean? Does it mean some functions are in-scope and others aren't?

Note: The part of this contract that is in scope is the execute method and transferOperatorship (i.e interactions with the auth contract, ignore the other commands).

Yep, what's mentioned above:

[08/03/2022 1:09 AM] entangled_qubit
@wardens Based on couple of questions I have received, I'd like to clarify one assumption we are making for the contracts (which is enforced at the axelar proof of stake network):
Operators correspond to validators on the Axelar network. However, the operator address for a given epoch is derived from the validator key along with a nonce that is unique for each operator epoch and chain.
i.e Whenever operatorship is being transferred, an honest validator will always generate a new operator address (and not reuse their old one) due to a nonce.

Maybe I'm misunderstanding the logic of `AxelarDepositService.sol`, but shouldn't the `refund` functions send tokens back to the `refundAddress`?

This is an immense hack because of the way it was replicated so easily by so many after the initial attack. Even worse was that the merkle tree root vuln was published following a security audit and Nomad's response was that it wasn't relevant. Another bridge yesterday, another hot wallet today (yes, I'm looking at you Phantom). Security is not a dirty word....
